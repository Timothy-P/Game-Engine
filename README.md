# Game Engine
This is a simple JS game engine. Is it anything interesting? No. Will it be simple? Of course. Will it take a while? Naturally.

# To-Do List
- Make velocity

- Make gravity

- Main loop?

# Purpose
This doesn't have much of a purpose. I'm making it just to make it. 

If someone decides to use it for something and it gets popularity, then good. If not, then just as good.

I enjoy making small/useful utilities that may have niche uses but someone might find it useful. Who knows?
